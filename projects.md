# Open source contributions

In addition to the projects above, here is a collection of open source
contributions worth mentioning.

## Kodi Media Center

[Kodi](https://kodi.tv) (formerly known as XBMC) is a popular open source media
player application. As long time Kodi user, I've contributed various bug fixes
and smaller features mainly in the area of PVR. Since January 2016 I'm
an official member of Team-Kodi and currently working on Kodi's CMake based
build system.

### MythTV PVR addon (pvr.mythtv.cmyth)

My involvement with Kodi (still called XBMC that time) started in 2012 with
maintaining the first version of Kodi's MythTV PVR plugin. The plugin supported
MythTV 0.25 - 0.27 and was based on [libcmyth](https://github.com/cmyth/cmyth).

* [Documentation](https://kodi.wiki/index.php?title=MythTV_PVR)
* [GitHub repository](https://github.com/fetzerch/xbmc-pvr-addons)

The development of the plugin for MythTV 0.28+ is being continued by
[janbar](https://github.com/janbar) as
[pvr.mythtv](https://github.com/janbar/pvr.mythtv).

## Jenkins Job Builder

[Jenkins Job Builder](https://docs.openstack.org/infra/jenkins-job-builder) is a tool
that simplifies the configuration of Jenkins CI jobs. I've contributed the
integration for the Valgrind and Clang scan-build publisher plugins that I'm
using for some of the projects mentioned on this page.
