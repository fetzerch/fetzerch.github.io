title: atMETEO - An ATmega based weather station
description: As its name implies atMETEO is a project for collecting and
             measuring weather related data from different sensors. The data is
             being collected by an ATmega based target and sent to a computer
             for further processing. From there the data can for example be
             fed into graphite in order to create graphs or passed on to a
             home automation server.

Besides logging and visualizing [internet connection statistics][fritzcollectd]
I wanted to track also local weather conditions and later eventually integrate
the data into a home automation system. While today there are proprietary and
free projects available that facilitate this, the topic seemed to be a perfect
candidate for a small spare time open source project, which I called
*[atMETEO]*.

## Project goals and introduction

Programming an ATmega based weather station not only allowed to deepen my
knowledge in electronics and microcontrollers, at the same time the project
served as practical accompaniment while reading Modern C++ Design and
C++ Templates and enabled me to explore the advantages and limits of
*modern C++ on 8 bit hardware*.

The essential concept of *atMETEO* is to read and interpret data from
sensors connected to the microcontroller and to transfer this
information to a connected PC for further processing, storing and
visualization.

Ideally *atMETEO* should hereby be able to access my already existing Hideki
TS53 RF sensors. Therefore a preliminary step was to
[reverse engineer][reveng433] their data format.

Conducting test automation is essential in order to develop a stable
product which can be left running unattended. For this purpose a [Jenkins]
server has been set up that runs [Clang Static Analyzer], builds all commits
and executes unit tests (including code coverage generation). In addition it
flashes new software periodically and maintains statistics on successful and
failed attempts to read sensor data for a given time range to identify possible
race conditions.

## Technical aspects

Even though microcontroller projects are usually hardware centric, the
main emphasis has been placed on the software part. My current setup utilizes
an [Arduino Uno][], but *atMETEO* is prepared to be built for different
ATmega boards with only minor adaption. Currently there are 5 sensor types
supported: Hideki TS53 Thermo/Hygrometer, DHT22 / AM2302 temperature and
humidity module, Bosch BMP180 Digital pressure sensor, Melexis MLX90614
Infrared thermometer and Figaro TGS 2600 air contaminant sensor. The RF
receiver as well as the other sensors are connected to the microcontroller as
shown in the following breadboard circuit (created with [Fritzing]).

On the software side the project is divided into two main parts.
A *libsensors* library contains the target / platform independent
functionality and algorithms and ships with unit tests that can be executed
on the host. All utilities for accessing ATmega hardware features (such as
pins, timers, UART, I2C (TWI), SPI) as well as an Ethernet driver
(WIZnet W5100) are part of *libtarget*. The main application makes then use of
both libraries in order to send the measured sensor data in JSON format over
UART or Ethernet (UDP) to the host.

*atMETEO* uses the [CMake] build system which controls cross compilation
(including flashing) as well as unit tests (including code coverage
generation) and [Doxygen] documentation.

Detailed information can be found in the project's [readme] and the
[documentation].

## Graphical user interface

[Graphite] and [grafana] are two excellent tools for logging and graphing time
series data. With the command line client *atMETEO* integrates nicely into
this setup as it can be configured to transfer measurements to graphite's
carbon daemon.

The following screenshot shows the *atMETEO* dashboard I am using to access
the measurements from PC, tablet or phone.

## Outlook and further work

*atMETEO* provides weather data now since more than 10 months, even though
hardware and circuit are still just built on a breadboard. One of the very
next steps therefore is to solder the sensors on a circuit board and fit
everything into a small enclosure.

The measurements are transferred to the host in JSON format. While this is
relatively easy to generate on the microcontroller, it requires to run an
*atMETEO* client application on the host to interpret the data and process it.
Therefore it would be beneficial to switch to a standard format such as [MQTT].
